# Hearth

Words condense into blocks of knowledge. Stare into the hearth,
the warm illumination from which knowledge flows into the mind. The mind loosens
its tension. Its rapt valves perhaps seized shut by repeated cycles of focused
intensity, as a welding torch narrowed to a needlepoint intensity stretches fine
lines into interweaving webs of steel hands interlocked to contain the pressure
pushing out, making all that wants to enter have to do so forcefully, bluntly,
and without invitation. Let the warm hearth embrace the web, soften its grasp,
and the hands will compensate their strong hold for a strong reach for
illumination, for the mind unseized sheds its infophobic leather and unfolds
into flower of infophillic flesh ready to diffuse the beads of inspiration
into its phloem and feel it pulse through its body. Expiration comes as your
words, and fireside shall you find your canvas prepared as it has waited,
beckoning your arrival.
